Some features that should be added

* More efficient api for read/write commands where we read/write straight
  from the socket into the buffer the application specified instead of as now
  we pass the data to a callback and then copy it.

* More scsi marshalling and unmarshalling functions in scsi-lowlevel

* Autoconnect for session faiulures.
  When the tcp session fail,   try several times to reconnect and relogin.
  If successful re-issue any commands that were in flight.

* Redirects

* Integrate with other relevant utilities such as 
  dvdrecord,
  ...

* Data Digest
